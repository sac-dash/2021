                    <p style="text-align: justify">Graduate students seeking feedback from the scientific community on their research ideas are invited to submit abstracts of their original unpublished and in-progress research work in areas of experimental computing and application development related to <a href='https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2021/index.html'>ACM SAC 2021</a> Tracks. The Student Research Competition (SRC) program is designed to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with researcher and practitioners in their areas of interest.</p>
		    <p style="text-align: justify">All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by researchers and practitioners with expertise in the track to which they are submitted. Authors of selected abstracts will have the opportunity to share and discuss their research work through poster and oral presentations and compete for the three top wining places as selected by the SRC committee. The winners will receive medals and cash awards during the conference banquet dinner. Invited authors will receive $500 from ACM toward their travel to participate in SAC SRC Program. Furthermore, invited authors are eligible to apply for the SIGAPP Student Travel Award Program (STAP) for support.

Please see <a href='https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2021/index.html'>ACM SAC 2021</a> website for the START system URL and the SRC Information Sheet (Downloads page). Abstracts must address original and unpublished research work related to a SAC track, submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed. The submission should address the research challenge and idea with emphasis on its relevance and originality (novelty), the proposed approach and research methodology, and sample preliminary results of the work as well as impact and applicability of the results to real-world problems. Only the name of the sole author of the work (graduate student) can appear on the submission, co-authors are not allowed.
