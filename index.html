                  <p style="text-align: justify">The ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has been a primary gathering forum for applied computer scientists, computer engineers, software engineers, and application developers from around the world. The ACM SAC 2021 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP), and will be held in Gwangju, Korea.</p></br>
                  <p style="text-align: justify">New era has begun; as rapid development of communication technology and infrastructure, distributed systems are becoming bigger and more complex. The characteristics of large-scale distributed systems also pose new problems to analyzing dependability, especially because of the geographical distribution of resources, volatility of resources, and constraints. As large-scale distributed systems not only consist of software and hardware but also requires generating, maintaining, and using data, data-driven analysis is required for software and hardware co-dependability.</p></br>
                  <p style="text-align: justify">The importance of ensuring software and hardware co-dependability is widely recognized and research projects have been initiated recently, but no acceptable solution was yet found that could analyze all the requirements for the large-scale distributed systems. For instance, analysis of reliability, availability, and security is extremely complex when software and hardware are highly co-related and frequently interact with each other in the large-scale distributed system. Rather than by intuition or by personal experience, data-driven analysis is now needed by more and more for software and hardware co-dependability.</p></br>
                  <p style="text-align: justify">The DASH track provides engineers and scientists from both industry and academia a platform to present their ongoing work, related research outcomes and experiences, and discuss the best and most efficient techniques for data-driven analysis for software and hardware co-dependability. This track also provides an excellent opportunity for the academic community to become more aware of the software and hardware co-dependability critical issues to the current industry.</p>
