                  <p style="text-align: justify">The ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has been a primary gathering forum for applied computer scientists, computer engineers, software engineers, and application developers from around the world. The <a href='https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2021/index.html'>ACM SAC 2021</a> is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP), is hosted by Chosun University and by Chonnam National University, Korea, and will be held in the Kimdaejung Convention Center, Gwangju, Korea.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify">New era has begun; as rapid development of communication technology and infrastructure, distributed systems are becoming bigger and more complex. The characteristics of large-scale distributed systems also pose new problems to analyzing dependability, especially because of the geographical distribution of resources, volatility of resources, and constraints. As large-scale distributed systems not only consist of software and hardware but also requires generating, maintaining, and using data, data-driven analysis is required for software and hardware co-dependability.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify">The importance of ensuring software and hardware co-dependability is widely recognized and research projects have been initiated recently, but no acceptable solution was yet found that could analyze all the requirements for the large-scale distributed systems. For instance, analysis of reliability, availability, and security is extremely complex when software and hardware are highly co-related and frequently interact with each other in the large-scale distributed system. Rather than by intuition or by personal experience, data-driven analysis is now needed by more and more for software and hardware co-dependability.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify">The DASH track provides engineers and scientists from both industry and academia a platform to present their ongoing work, related research outcomes and experiences, and discuss the best and most efficient techniques for data-driven analysis for software and hardware co-dependability. This track also provides an excellent opportunity for the academic community to become more aware of the software and hardware co-dependability critical issues to the current industry.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify">Original papers addressing any of the above listed topics of interest (or related topics) are considered. Each submitted paper will be fully refereed and undergo a blind review process by at least three referees: authorsâ€™ names and affiliations must not appear in the paper, self-citations should be in the third person, and authors must avoid disclosing their identity by any means. The paper length is limited to 8 pages, but 2 additional pages at extra charge are allowed (max of 10 pages). Some papers may only be accepted as posters. The poster length is limited to 3 pages, but one addition page at extra charge is allowed (max of 4 pages).

                  <p style="text-align: justify">The paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending ACM SAC MUST present the paper: This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library. No-show of scheduled papers and posters will result in excluding them from the ACM/IEEE digital library.</p>

                  <h2 style="color:#0000FF">Student Research Competition(SRC) Program</h2>
                  <p style="text-align: justify">Graduate students seeking feedback from the scientific community on their research ideas are invited to submit abstracts of their original unpublished and in-progress research work in areas of experimental computing and application development related to SAC 2021 Tracks. The Student Research Competition (SRC) program is designed to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with researcher and practitioners in their areas of interest.</p>
		  <p style="text-align: justify">All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by researchers and practitioners with expertise in the track to which they are submitted. Authors of selected abstracts will have the opportunity to share and discuss their research work through poster and oral presentations and compete for the three top wining places as selected by the SRC committee. The winners will receive medals and cash awards during the conference banquet dinner. Invited authors will receive $500 from ACM toward their travel to participate in SAC SRC Program. Furthermore, invited authors are eligible to apply for the SIGAPP Student Travel Award Program (STAP) for support. The top winner is eligible to proceed to the ACM National SRC Program for the grand finals.</p>
		  <h3>SRC Submission</h3>
			<p style="text-align: justify">Graduate students are invited to submit original abstracts of their research work in areas of experimental computing and application development. Please submit your research abstracts electronically to the SRC START submission system in PDF format, maximum 4 pages in ACM camera-ready format. Please see <a href='https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2021/index.html'>ACM SAC 2021</a> website for the START system URL and the SRC Information Sheet (Downloads page). Abstracts must address original and unpublished research work related to a SAC track, submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed. The submission should address the research challenge and idea with emphasis on its relevance and originality (novelty), the proposed approach and research methodology, and sample preliminary results of the work as well as impact and applicability of the results to real-world problems. Only the name of the sole author of the work (graduate student) can appear on the submission, co-authors are not allowed. The sole author must attend SAC and participate to qualify for the SRC travel support and competition, no proxies or substitutions are permitted.</p>
